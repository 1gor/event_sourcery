# EventSourcery

A framework for building event sourced, CQRS applications.

## Goals

The goal of EventSourcery is to make it easier to build event sourced, CQRS applications.

The hope is that by using EventSourcery you can focus on modeling your domain with aggregates, commands, and events; and not worry about stitching together application plumbing.

## Core Concepts

Refer to [core concepts](./docs/core-concepts.md) to learn about the core pieces of EventSourcery.

## Getting Started Guide

**TODO**

## Configuration

There are several ways to configure Event Sourcery to your liking. The following presents some examples:

```ruby
EventSourcery.configure do |config|
  # Add custom reporting of errors occurring during event processing.
  # One might set up Rollbar here.
  config.on_event_processor_error = proc { |exception, processor_name| â€¦ }

  # Enable Event Sourcery logging.
  config.logger = Logger.new('logs/my_event_sourcery_app.log')

  # Customize how event body attributes are serialized
  config.event_body_serializer
    .add(BigDecimal) { |decimal| decimal.to_s('F') }

  # Config how your want to handle event processing errors
  config.error_handler_class = EventSourcery::EventProcessing::ErrorHandlers::ExponentialBackoffRetry
end
```

## Applications that use EventSourcery

- [Identity](https://github.com/envato/identity) (note that this was the ES/CQRS implementation that ES was initially extracted from).
- [Payables](https://github.com/envato/payables).
- [Calendar Example App](https://github.com/envato/calendar-es-example).

## Development

### Dependencies

- Postgresql
- Ruby

### Running the Test Suite

Run the `setup` script, inside the project directory to install the gem dependencies and create the test database (if it is not already created).
```bash
./bin/setup
```

Then you can run the test suite with rspec:
```bash
rspec
```
